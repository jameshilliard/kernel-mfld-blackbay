	  This will enable a lightweight tracer of commands submitted
	  to the GPU.

	  Besides the command type the trace output will provide the
	  timestamp, id and name of the submitting process and a
	  a snapshots of the synchronization counters related to the
	  given command.

	  The trace can help for example in debugging dead-lock
	  situations caused by circular lock dependencies.

This driver is a forward port of the Poulsbo/Langwell/Penwell SGX graphics and
display controller drivers from 2.6.37 to 3.0-rc-something.

The starting point was the meego-kernel-branch-mrst-k37 branch on [1]. The
commits touching drivers/staging/mrst directory were exported to patches using:

$ git format-patch -1000 meego-kernel-branch-mrst-k37 -- drivers/staging/mrst

Note that the above filters out the changes outside drivers/staging/mrst.

The patches were then applied on top of the MID repository [2]. Possibly due to
rebases in the original tree [1] there were some conflicts that were
resolved. In the end, this did not report any diff:

$ git diff meego-kernel-branch-mrst-k37 -- drivers/staging/mrst

After this, the build problems were fixed one by one.


TODO

* Make it work.

* Continuous: Merge [2] (and thus Linus' tree) here as it is updated.

* Review the hacked up quick fixes to build problems.

* Possibly update the DDK version.

* Merge the diverged and polished drivers/staging/gma500 back with this driver.

* Finally: Backport the combined drivers and hardware adaptation to desired
  kernel version.


NOTES

There is arch/x86/configs/medfield_pvr_defconfig known to work. It excludes the
drivers/staging/gma500 driver as long as the drivers have not been merged.
